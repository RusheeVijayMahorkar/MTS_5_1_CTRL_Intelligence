TQS Google Cloud Settlement File Automation Pipeline
🚀 Hackathon – GCP Cloud Functions (.NET 8)
📌 Overview
This project is developed as part of the Google Cloud Hackathon.
Our solution is built entirely on Google Cloud Functions, using .NET 8 as the runtime.
✅ No separate UI is created — all functionality runs serverlessly in GCP Console.
✅ To share and test the logic, we have created a .NET 8 Console Application that mirrors the same function code.
